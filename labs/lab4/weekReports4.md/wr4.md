## Basic Terminology

File system - the way files are stored and organized 

Current directory- the directory where you are at the moment 

parent directory- the directory containing the current directory

Difference between **YOUR HOME** directory and **THE HOME** directory
    - "THE HOME" comes with everything under the root directory.
    - "YOUR HOME" contains the user's data.

pathname- indicates the location of the file in the filesystem 

relative path- the location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory

absolute path- the location of a file starting at the root of the file system
